Pure Python implementation of a voice recognition system
--------------------------------------------------------

This project uses labeled audio files in order to build a fature-vector based model and be able to recognize some characteristics on a new unlabeled audio. 

Pattern analysis is based on MFCC coefficients and GMM models.

Applications:

  - automatic media indexing
  - diverse contact center applications


Keywords:
  - pattern recognition
  - signal processing
  - audio fingerprinting


Alternatively, neural networks, SVM, kD-Trees or other mechanisms can be applied to perform better recognition.
